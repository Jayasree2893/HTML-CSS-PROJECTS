        Drinking fruit juice can be a good way to get one or two servings of fruit and increase the amount of antioxidants you consume. Fruit juice can be high in calories if it has added sugar, an important caveat for those watching sugar intake.
        It's also important to choose 100% fruit juice, rather than soft drinks made with fruit juice, because the nutritional value per calorie is more beneficial in 100% juice.
        There are many different juices and juice blends to choose from, but the most nutritious juice varieties include orange juice, pomegranate juice, and pink grapefruit juice.
