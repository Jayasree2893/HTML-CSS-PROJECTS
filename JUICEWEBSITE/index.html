    <h2>About Us</h2>
   <P> Here at Juice shop we stay focused on making healthy food that nurtures the soul and body. We focus on making food that can fit into any dietary restrictions whether it be keto, gluten free, or vegan.
We have been serving Seattle fresh, organic food and juice since 1992. Having survived the pandemic we now offer juice and meal plan subscriptions that we will deliver it all to your door! Making it easy for you to enjoy the benefits of our cold pressed juice. Our 12oz bottle of cold pressed juice contains 2 pounds of fresh, organic produce.
It’s a delicious, and easily digestible way to get your daily fruit and veggies.
With juice, the body absorbs the nutrients more readily than food that needs to be broken down.
The world has changed and we have changed with it. Our passion to serve health focused foods/juice to Seattle hasn’t been dampened. 
We have cultivated a strong delivery system so everyone can benefit from our RAW Cold Pressed juice 
and meal plans.</P>

            What is juicing?
        </summary>
        Juicing is a process that extracts the juices from fresh fruits and vegetables.
It usually strips away most of the solid matter, including the seeds and pulp, from whole fruits and vegetables.
The resulting liquid contains most of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants naturally present in the whole fruit or vegetable.
